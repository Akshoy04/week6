# Data Structures in C - Stack and Linked List Operations

This repository contains implementations of fundamental data structure programs in C.  
The programs cover linked lists, stack operations, and expression conversions.

## Table of Contents
1. Singly Linked List Operations  
2. Intermediate Linked List Tasks  
3. Stack Implementation  
4. Expression Conversion and Evaluation  

---

## 1. Singly Linked List Operations
- Create a singly linked list and display its elements  
- Insert a new node:
  - At the beginning  
  - At the end  
  - At a specified position  
- Delete a node:
  - From the beginning  
  - From the end  
  - From a specified position  
- Count the total number of nodes in the linked list  
- Search for a particular value in the linked list  

---

## 2. Intermediate Linked List Tasks
- Remove all nodes that have duplicate information  
- Print the total number of occurrences of a given item  
- Multiply every element of the linked list by 10  
- Check whether a linked list is sorted (in ascending order)  
- Reverse a linked list using:
  - Iteration  
  - Recursion  

---

## 3. Stack Implementation
### Array-based Implementation
- Implement a stack using an array  
- Push and pop elements  
- Display the stack after each operation  
- Check for stack overflow and underflow conditions  

### Linked List-based Implementation
- Implement a stack using a linked list  
- Push and pop elements dynamically  
- Display the stack after each operation

## 4. Expression Conversion and Evaluation
- Convert an infix expression to:
  - Postfix form (example: `a+b → ab+`)  
  - Prefix form (example: `a+b → +ab`)  
- Evaluate:
  - Postfix expression  
  - Prefix expression

## Compilation and Execution
Each program can be compiled and executed individually using the GCC compiler.
